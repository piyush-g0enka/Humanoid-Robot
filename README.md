# Face Recognition and NLP Application Project

## Overview

In this project, we have developed an application that utilizes facial recognition technology to identify people's faces. Additionally, the application is equipped with Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to engage in conversations with users. The text processing is achieved through a combination of Google Dialogflow and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The application is designed to interface with a Humanoid Robot.
